# Workshop

This repository contains a collection of Nosana Workshops.
Each workshop is targeted at a specific use case to get familiar with the Nosana tool-suite.

The repository is originally created to assist in live Nosana workshops,
but each assignment should be self-explanatory and be do-able by just it's documentation. 

The [assignments](./assignments) directory contains the various workshops.

## Assignments

The following assignments can be found in the collection

### [Web3 Labs](./assignments/web3-labs)

A small example to get familiar in automating a polygon contract deployment.
